\page mRM mRM - the Multiscale Routing Model: Running the stand-alone version of the routing model

\section intro_mRM Introduction to mRM

This section provides information on how to run the routing model mRM
as a stand-alone program outside of mHM. The general philosophy is as
follows: mRM can be compiled and run in a similar way as mHM. Specific
files for mRM can be found in the main path and are denoted as
<filename>_mRM.<file_type>, where <filename>.<file_type> is the
corresponding mHM file.

This Subsection provides a short description of the method used in
mRM. For further details and an analysis over the European domain,
please refer to Thober et al. 2019.

\subsection findif Finite Difference Approximation of Kinematic Wave Equation

The multiscale Routing Model mRM uses the kinematic wave equation to
describe the water flow within a stream as

\f{equation}{
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
\f}

where \f$Q\f$ (m\f$^3\f$\,s\f$^{-1}\f$) is streamflow, \f$x\f$ (m) the space dimension,
\f$t\f$ (s) the time dimension, and \f$c\f$ (m\,s\f$^{-1}\f$) the celerity. The
kinematic wave equation is a simplification of the Saint-Venant
equations. The derivation is based on the assumption
that the continuity equation is sufficient to describe the movement of
flood waves. In detail, a constant river bed slope and time-invariant
celerity \f$c\f$ have to be assumed. mRM employs
the classical finite difference weighted approximation on a four points
scheme to solve the equation above. A short derivation is as follows:

The partial derivatives within the above equation are represented as
finite differences between four values, that means on two locations at
two points in time:

\f{eqnarray*}{
   \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} & \approx \frac{\epsilon \left(Q(x_j,t_{i+1})
     - Q(x_j, t_i)\right) + (1 -
   \epsilon)\left(Q(x_{j+1}, t_{i+1})-Q(x_{j+1}, t_i)\right)}{\Delta t} , \\
   \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} & \approx \frac{\varphi
     \left(Q(x_{j+1}, t_{i+1})
     - Q(x_j, t_{i+1})\right) + (1 -
   \varphi)\left(Q(x_{j+1}, t_i)-Q(x_j, t_i)\right)}{\Delta x} , \nonumber
\f}

where \f$j\f$ denotes the spatial location (i.e., reach id) and \f$i\f$ denotes
the timestep. \f$\epsilon\f$ is a space-weighting factor and \f$\varphi\f$ is a
time-weighting factor. mRM uses a rectangular grid to represent the
river network with a river reach in the model connecting two center grid
locations. Different spatial locations are separated by \f$\Delta x\f$ and
time steps by \f$\Delta t\f$. The two weighting factors, \f$\epsilon\f$ and
\f$\varphi\f$, can be chosen between 0 and 1, but the numerical solution
becomes unstable for \f$\epsilon >\f$ 0.5. The
numerical diffusion depends linearly on \f$\epsilon\f$,
with 0 implying full numerical diffusion and 0.5 no numerical diffusion,
respectively.

Setting \f$\varphi\f$ to 0.5, which represents a time-centered scheme, and
substituting the above equation into
equation (9.1) results in the classical linear equation:

\f{equation}{
 Q(x_{j+1}, t_{i+1}) = C_1 Q(x_j, t_{i+1}) + C_2 Q(x_j, t_i) + C_3
 Q(x_{j+1}, t_i) ,
\f}
with the coefficients \f$C_1\f$, \f$C_2\f$ and \f$C_3\f$ being:
\f{eqnarray}{
   C_1 & = \frac{-2 \Delta x \epsilon + c \Delta t}{2 \Delta x (1 -
     \epsilon) + c \Delta t} , \nonumber \\
   C_2 & = \frac{2 \Delta x \epsilon + c \Delta t}{2 \Delta x (1 -
     \epsilon) + c \Delta t} , \\
   C_3 & = \frac{2 \Delta x (1 - \epsilon) - c \Delta t}{2 \Delta x (1 -
     \epsilon) + c \Delta t} . \nonumber
\f}
The coefficients \f$C_1\f$, \f$C_2\f$ and \f$C_3\f$ add up to one. The spatial
resolution at which mRM is applied is called
``routing'' resolution in the following.

\subsection slope_to_c Stream Celerity Parametrization based on Terrain Slope

Two parametrizations of equation (9.3) are available in
mRM: firstly the regionalized Muskingum-Cunge (rMC) parametrization with
a fixed time step, and
secondly a parametrization using spatially varying
celerities in combination with an adaptive time step (aTS). A short
summary of the former is presented in Subsection \ref rMC and is referred to
as rMC in the following. The latter is described in detail in this and
the next section and is referred to as aTS scheme.

The aTS calculates stream celerity as a function of terrain slope using
a simple relationship:

\f{equation}{
 c_i = \gamma \sqrt{s_i},
\f}
where \f$c_i\f$, \f$s_i\f$ and \f$\gamma\f$ are celerity, terrain slope and a free
model parameter, respectively, and \f$i\f$ is the grid cell index.

The above equation is applied at the resolution of the Digital
Elevation Model (DEM), from which terrain slope is derived. A median
absolute deviation (MAD) filter is applied to the
high resolution slope data along the path of the main river with a
threshold value of 2.25 to correct for outliers. Large slope outliers
happen easily in DEMs, for example, when the river flows in a valley
and one grid cell represents the valley while the next grid cell
represents the hill top. A minimum river bed slope of 0.1% is
further assumed. The celerities are then upscaled to the routing
resolution, i.e., the resolution at which the kinematic wave equation
is solved. The upscaling is by averaging with
the harmonic mean, the correct averaging operator for celerities (or
speed). The upscaling considers also only those high-resolution grid
cells that align with the path of the main river because aTS only
considers the flow in the main river reach, assuming that travel times
in the main reach dominate the routing process in
tributaries.

\subsection ada_time Adaptive Time Step (aTS) Implementation

The aTS scheme uses an adaptive time step to calculate the linear
coefficients in equation (9.2). The basic idea is that the
time step should be such that water has not been transported further
than \f$\Delta x\f$ during a single step. This condition is generally known
as Courant-Friedrich-Lewy criterium, which is a necessary condition for
numerical stability of finite difference schemes
\cite Courant:1928ch. The condition can be expressed as:

\f{equation}{
 C_r = \frac{c \Delta t}{\Delta x} \le C_{max} = 1
\f}

where \f$C_{max}\f$ is the Courant number. aTS uses a Courant number
of 1. The Courant condition couples the applied spatial resolution
with the integration time step of the finite difference
scheme. Celerities \f$c_i\f$ are typically in the order of a few
m s\f$^{-1}\f$ The time step \f$\Delta t\f$ is chosen such
that it does not deviate too much from the Courant number
\f$C_{max}\f$ to keep computational
demand to a minimum. This implies that \f$\Delta t\f$ ranges from a
few minutes for high-resolution grids to a few hours for continental
scale applications.

In detail, aTS chooses \f$\Delta t\f$ from a set of prescribed values such
that \f$c_i\Delta t/\Delta x\f$ is close to but less than 1 for all
celerities \f$c_i\f$. The prescribed values range from one minute to one
day, namely: 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, 5 min, 6 min, 10 min,
12 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h,
12 h, and 1 day. The choice of these values is motivated from the fact
that these represent multiples or dividers of hourly and daily time
steps. These time steps allow in principle model applications from
100 m to 100 km, for typical celerities around 1.5 m s\f$^{-1}\f$.

Note that the chosen time step depends only on the spatial resolution
and is independent of the time resolution of the provided forcing. For
example, applying aTS at 12 km resolution using a celerity of \f$c\f$~=
1.5 m s\f$^{-1}\f$ gives \f$\Delta x/c\f$ of 2.2 hours and, hence, a time
step of two hours will be chosen. If mRM is forced with hourly input, it
will aggregate the input over two consecutive time steps prior to the
routing. The calculated streamflow is then distributed to the previous
two time steps because these represent the mean flow over this
period. If aTS is forced with daily input, it will use internally 12
iterations of 2-hour time steps to route the water through the river
network. In this case, aTS will also return the average of the
calculated 12 streamflow values at each reach.

\subsection rMC Regionalized Muskingum-Cunge parametrization

The regionalized Muskingum-Cunge (rMC) parametrization implemented in
the mesoscale Hydrologic Model mHM calculates the Muskingum coefficients
\f$C_1\f$, \f$C_2\f$, and \f$C_3\f$ in equation (9.2) as a function of
high-resolution river network properties. The coefficients \f$C_1\f$, \f$C_2\f$,
and \f$C_3\f$ are parametrized as follows

\f{equation}{
     C_1 = \nu_2; C_2 = \nu_1 - \nu_2; C_3 = 1 - \nu_1,
\f}

 where the parameters \f$\nu_1\f$ and \f$\nu_2\f$ are given as

\f{eqnarray}{
     \nu_1 &= \frac{\Delta t}{\beta (1 - \epsilon) + \frac{\Delta t}{2}};\\
     \nu_2 &= \frac{\frac{\Delta t}{2} - \beta \epsilon}{\beta (1 - \epsilon) + \frac{\Delta t}{2}} \nonumber
\f}

 following the nomenclature of appendix A2 in
 \cite SKA2010. This formulation is identical to
 equatio (9.3) of the present study, using
 \f$\beta = \Delta x / c\f$ in the equation above and substituting this
 equation into two equations above. The parameters
 \f$\beta\f$ and \f$\epsilon\f$ are then conceptualized as

 \f{eqnarray}{
     \beta &= \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 L + \gamma_3 S + \gamma_4 C ;\\
     \epsilon &= \gamma_5 \frac{S}{max(S)} , \nonumber
 \f}

 where \f$L\f$ is the length of the reach, \f$S\f$ is the slope of the reach,
 and \f$C\f$ is the fraction of impervious land cover within the floodplains
 (see table 4 in \cite KS2012). Overall, there are five global
 parameters \f$\gamma_1\f$ to \f$\gamma_5\f$ in the above equation that
 can be chosen by the user. The integration time step is fixed at one
 hour. To guarantee the numerical stability of the parameterization, the
 following upper and lower bounds are applied

 \f{eqnarray}{
   0 & < \epsilon \le 0.5,\\
   \frac{\Delta t}{2(1-\epsilon)} & < \beta \le \frac{\Delta t}{2 \epsilon},
 \f}

 where \f$\Delta t\f$ is set to one hour.

\section start_mRM Getting Started

For receiving mRM, installing NETCDF, and running mRM under CYGWIN on
Windows, please follow Sections \ref NETCDF, \ref windows, and \ref compile.

\subsection compile_mRM Compiling mRM

The compilation of mRM can be achieved by running the *make* command
on the **Makefile_mRM** file. This can be done in two ways:

1. make -f Makefile_mRM
2. renaming of Makefile_mRM to Makefile via

    \code
    mv Makefile_mRM Makefile
    \endcode

\subsection test_mRM Test mRM on Example Basin

The received mHM distribution contains an example test basin in the
folder

\code
test_basin/
\endcode

This folder also contains all necessary data to run mRM. After you
compiled mRM, simply run the executable via

\code
./mrm
\endcode

Ouput will be written in the \code test_basin/output_b1 \endcode

\subsection run_mRM Run your own Simulation

As for mHM, there are three mRM configuration files. These are:

- mrm.nml
- mrm_output.nml
- mrm_parameter.nml

Please note that the information contained in these files can also be
found in the respective files for mHM because mRM is part of mHM.

\subsubsection mrmnml Main configuration: Path, Periods, Switches

The file <code>mrm.nml</code> contains the main configuration for running mRM in your catchments. Since the comments should explain
each single setting, this section will only roughly describe the
structure of the file. All mandatory namelists have to specified
explicitly for both mHM and mRM. Namelists that are specific for mRM
are denoted by <code>_mRM</code>. Please keep in mind, that paths can be relative, absolute and even symbolic links.

\li <b>project_description:</b> Defines meta data that is written in
the output netcdf files.
\li <b>mainconfig:</b> Defines number of basins and hydrology
resolution.
\li <b>mainconfig_mhm_mrm:</b> Defines input paths for reading restart
files, routing resolution, and optimization.
\li <b>mainconfig_mrm:</b> Defines file name, variable name, and data
convention for runoff input field for mRM.
\li <b>directories_general:</b> Defines common input and output paths
for mHM and mRM.
\li <b>directories_mRM:</b> Defines paths where gauge information and
input runoff fields can be found.
\li <b>processSelection:</b> Only processCase seven is used for mRM,
all other options are ignored.
\li <b>LCover:</b> defines information on LAI data.
\li <b>time_periods:</b> Defines simulation periods.
\li <b>evaluation_gauges:</b> Defines number of gauges per basin and
file names containing gauge observations.
\li <b>Optimization:</b> Defines parameters for optimization.

\subsection mrmoutputnml Output Configuration: Time Steps, States, Fluxes

The file <code>mrm_outputs.nml</code> regulates how often (e.g. <code>timeStep_model_outputs_mrm = 24</code>) and which variables (fluxes and states) should be
written to the final netcdf file <code>[OUTPUT_DIRECTORY]/mRM_Fluxes_States.nc</code>. We recommend to only switch on variables that are of actual interest,
because the file size will greatly increase with the number of containing variables. During calibration (see \ref calibration) no output file will be written.

\subsection calib_mRM Calibration and Optimization

The parameter calibration can be conducted in the same way as for
mHM. Please see Section \ref calibration and Section \ref paramopt for
details. Parameters contained in the **mrm_parameter.nml** are
considered during the optimization.

\section data_mRM Data preparation for mRM

The data preparation for the static data for mRM is identical to that
of mHM. It is described in the
Chapter "Data preparation for mHM" in
subsection \ref extractncsize, \ref extractncdata, \ref latlon, \ref
morph (with the exception of soil map, hydrogeological map, LAI map),
\ref gis (with the exception
of aspect), \ref lcover, and \ref tables.

Additionally, forcing data is required. The forcing for mRM is
grid-scale runoff. This runoff needs to be provided in a netcdf file
that follows the input format of mHM for forcing variables. The only
difference to the forcing variables is that the variable and file name
can be both provided in the <code>mrm.nml</code> file in the namelist <code>mainconfig_mrm</code>.

Please see other details in Section \ref meteo.
